# yotp
One time password generator (think google authenticator, two factor authentication)

Works with mono and dotnetcore. I would assume it works with windows, but I haven't tried it.

## the future
* reorganize to be more object oriented
* clean up all the magic numbers and replace with constants and tuneables
* embed lua to one shot configuration files and extensability/plugins
* make a steam and battle.net plugin
